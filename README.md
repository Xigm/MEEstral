# Project Title

Project with the aim to implement and analyze the impact on computation of EE in LLMs: Transformers and Mamba.

This codes may (should) train any Mistral model (transformer or mamba) with EEs for its usage.

## Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project locally. This might include cloning the repository and installing dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xigm/EE_Clean.git
```

Install environment with the environment.yml file. Linux OS is requiered.

```bash
conda env create -n your_env_name -f environment.yml
```

Install Cuda toolkit (version 11.6+, I used 12.3)

```bash
conda activate your_env_name
pip install causal-conv1d
pip install mamba-ssm
```

## Usage

To train your own early exits go to file train.py. Specify where the EE's are placed. Training is perfomed with the dataset FineWeb-Edu.

To test inference of the models go to file inference_EE.py. Select the model and modify the input.
